TODO

	log is a reserved key in depository
	passphrase is a reserved key in dark

NICE TO HAVE

	Have an interative move.
	Verify all options, raise exception on unrecognized options

DONE

	Get password from ENV?
		Done by file instead
	Write README.txt and documentation.
	Review what libraries are used
	0.upto(0xff).map{|i| i.chr}.select{|c| c=~/\w/}...
	a.digest.chars.each{|x| y=x.ord+r; r=y/63; puts r; string+=b[y % 63] }; while something like... string += b[r]  to finish up.

	Set timestamps to EPOCH
	Don't forget touch/untouch
		It really is neccessary!!!!
		There's no point in doing this for repositories as they keep their own timestamps,
		but it's done for dark.

	do a checksum of ci'ins to verify success?

	a file of resources NOT NECCESSARY!!! :))

	gpg --batch --passphrase-fd 0 --symmetric
	First line is passphrase.
